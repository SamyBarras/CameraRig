# CameraRig
CameraRig builder and tools for After Effects

- The whole repository can be dowloaded to the "Scripts" folder in the After Effects application folder.
- The "CameraRig v4.0" folder should have parenthesis to avoid After Effects loading all scripts contained into it : "(CameraRig v.4.0)"
- You should have administrator rights, or at least rights to access to the PresetEffects.xml file in the After Effect application folder, to let the script create is own effect template.

CameraRig and tools are combined in a Custom UI panel, so once installed you'll find into under the Windows menu in After Effects.
